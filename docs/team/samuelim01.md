### Project: WedLog

WedLog is a desktop application created for partners getting married that helps them manage the guests and vendors involved in the wedding. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. This project is based on [AddressBook - Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).
